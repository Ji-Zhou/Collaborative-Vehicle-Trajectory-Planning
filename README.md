# Collaborative Vehicle Trajectory Planning
  
This repository includes several demonstration videos of tested cases for review purposes. The complete codebase will be made publicly available upon completion of the peer-review process.  
  
# Overview

While autonomous vehicle applications in urban areas face significant limitations, they demonstrate remarkable efficiency in controlled areas such as open-pit mines. Existing research on collaborative vehicle trajectory planning predominantly focuses on structured roads with clearly defined lanes. However, unstructured environments which characterized by dynamic conflict areas (e.g. loading areas, unloading areas and multi-phase intersections) present unique challenges distinct from urban settings.    
ï»¿In these unstructured environments, the absence of designated lanes combined with overlapping vehicle paths during transportation tasks often leads to potential deadlocks. Our research addresses this critical gap by developing a robust trajectory planning solution specifically designed for high-conflict, unstructured scenarios.

For all configurations, the line connecting the start and end points of the vehicles passes through the center of the square, representing a challenging case designed to qualitatively assess the efficiency of the proposed method. Following three figures clearly show the configuration of the tested case and effectiveness of proposed methods.

Current mining operations typically deploy fewer than 30 autonomous vehicles per site, making our 16-vehicle tests representative while sufficiently challenging.
